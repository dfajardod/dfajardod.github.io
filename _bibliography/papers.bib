  abstract = {Paralinguistics is an essential component of verbal communication, comprising elements that provide additional information to the language, such as emotional signals. However, the subjective nature of perceiving affective aspects, such as emotions, poses a significant challenge to the development of quality resources for training recognition models of paralinguistic features. Labelers may have different opinions and perceive different emotions from others, making it difficult to achieve a diverse and sufficient representation of considered categories. In this study, we focused on the automatic classification of paralinguistic aspects in Spanish-speaking Mexican children of elementary school age. However, the dataset presents a strong imbalance in all labeled aspects and a low agreement between the labelers. Furthermore, the audio samples were too short, making it challenging to accurately classify affective speech. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that combines data balancing algorithms and semisupervised learning to improve the classification performance of the trained models. Our method aims to mitigate the subjectivity involved in labeling paralinguistic data, thus advancing the development of robust and accurate recognition models of affective aspects in speech.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a new filter to remove impulse noise in digital color images. The filter is adaptive in the sense that it uses a detection stage to only correct noisy pixels. Detecting noisy pixels is performed by a binary classification model generated via genetic programming, a paradigm of evolutionary computing based on natural biological selection. The classification model training considers three impulse noise models in color images: salt and pepper, uniform, and correlated. This is the first filter generated by genetic programming exploiting the correlation among the color image channels. The correction stage consists of a vector median filter version that modifies color channel values if some are noisy. An experimental study was performed to compare the proposed filter with others in the state-of-the-art related to color image denoising. Their performance was measured objectively through the image quality metrics PSNR, MAE, SSIM, and FSIM. Experimental findings reveal substantial variability among filters based on noise model and image characteristics. The findings also indicate that, on average, the proposed filter consistently exhibited top-tier performance values for the three impulse noise models, surpassed only by a filter employing a deep learning-based approach. Unlike deep learning filters, which are black boxes with internal workings invisible to the user, the proposed filter has a high interpretability with a performance close to an equilibrium point for all images and noise models used in the experiment.},

  abstract = { In this paper, the clamping effect introduced by several diode-based configurations used for the implementation of the high-value resistors in quasi-floating-gate circuits is analyzed and characterized. In contrast to previous approaches where a parasitic diode is treated as a simple high-value resistor reducing the circuit complexity, in this case the analysis considers the diode behavior which leads to a clamping circuit. This clamping circuit introduces an unwanted amplitude-dependent offset voltage, which affects the performance moving the quiescent point at the quasi-floating-gate transistors. A new anti-parallel diode configuration for quasi-floating-gate applications is proposed in this work, which eliminates this unwanted offset voltage. The proposed design is validated using simulations and experimental data in a CMOS 0.35-μm technology. },

To mitigate workload imbalances, this work proposes a concurrent agent-based problem-solving technique supported by cooperative game theory capable of balancing workloads by means of live migration of virtual machines (VMs). Nearby agents managing physical hosts are partitioned into coalitions in which agents play coalitional games to progressively balance separate sections of a data center while considering the coalition's benefit of migrating a VM as well as its associated network overhead. Simulation results show that, in general, the proposed coalition-based load balancing mechanism outperformed a load balancing mechanism based on a hill-climbing algorithm used by a top data center vendor when considering altogether (i) the standard deviation of resource usage, (ii) the number of migrations, and (iii) the number of switch hops per migration.},

Our analysis identified the main methodologies, tools, data sources, and other relevant features in the field. One of the principal contributions of this study is a taxonomy for using NLP in tourism. In addition, metadata were examined using a threefold approach: (i) general statistics, (ii) abstract text analysis, and (iii) keyword networks.

  ABSTRACT = {A ridesharing system is a transport mode where two or more users share the same vehicle and divide the trip&rsquo;s expenses based on similar routes and itineraries. Popular ridesharing systems, such as Uber, Flinc, and Lyft, define a matching among users based only on the coincidence of routes. However, these systems do not guarantee a stable matching (i.e., a matching in which no user prefers another different from the assigned one). In this work, a new ridesharing system model is proposed, including three types of trips: identical, inclusive, and partial. This model is used to introduce a new algorithm to address the stable matching problem for ridesharing systems. Finally, a set of experimental simulations of the proposed algorithm is conducted. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm always produces a stable matching.},

Un problema recurrente en el uso de datos ópticos es que son espacial y temporalmente discontinuos, con valores perdidos debido a multitud de factores como puede ser condiciones climáticas adversas, baja resolución temporal, fallos en el sensor, entre otras. Como consecuencia, se necesitan soluciones de relleno de huecos de datos para un monitoreo preciso de los cultivos.

Éste permite realizar diferentes tareas en series temporales en productos Sentinel-2, las cuales incluyen: (1) generar series temporales con datos espacialmente continuos a partir de datos discontinuos utilizando dos métodos de interpolación: Series de Fourier y Whittaker, (2) detectar parámetros fenológicos (inicio de temporada, pico mas alto y fin de la temporada, es decir etapas clave de crecimiento del cultivo) y (3) Reconstruir mapas de algún índice espectral de un día del cual no se tengan datos. El toolbox ha sido probado en una zona cultivada con caña de azúcar, y los resultados muestran que el método Whittaker es que mejor interpola los datos. Este toolbox beneficiará a los agricultores para un mejor monitoreo del cultivo de la caña de azúcar, considerando todos los días del ciclo de desarrollo y expresado a través de un índice espectral.},

In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm for the maximum 2-packing set problem on arbitrary graphs, which is an NP-hard problem. To the best of our knowledge, this work is a pioneering effort to tackle this problem for arbitrary graphs. For comparison, we extended and outperformed a well-known genetic algorithm originally designed for the maximum independent set problem. We also compared our genetic algorithm with a polynomial-time one for the maximum 2-packing set problem on cactus graphs. Empirical results show that our genetic algorithm is capable of finding 2-packing sets with a cardinality relatively close (or equal) to that of the maximum 2-packing sets. Moreover, the cardinality of the 2-packing sets found by our genetic algorithm increases linearly with the number of vertices and with a larger population and a larger number of generations. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical proof demonstrating that our genetic algorithm increases the fitness for each candidate solution when certain conditions are met.},

In this work, we address the noise reduction problem by using an estimation of the standard deviation in CR images as an objective function to minimize. We propose a hybrid genetic algorithm for this aim, which produces improved versions of CR images. We also applied an edge-detection method based on the Canny algorithm to preserve the edges of the original CR images. We executed our proposed algorithm for CR images obtained under different radiation exposures. Experimental results show that our solution improves lower radiation CR images reaching a quality as similar to those with higher radiation doses.},

  abstract = {In recent years, remote sensing has become a fundamental tool for the development of precision agriculture. Through crop information, crop prediction models can be developed, plant photosynthetic capacity can be estimated, and the relationship between biomass accumulation and yield under certain environmental conditions can be understood. It can be achieved through the estimation of a vegetation index called the leaf area index (LAI) using remote sensing techniques and from the map of the region of interest. However, remote sensing has some limitations in terms of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution of the available images. Earth observation satellites offer multitemporal images that are used to assess and monitor the state of vegetation. Sentinel-2 satellites of the European Space Agency are part of these technologies. This article proposes a methodology with free software libraries for the processing of images obtained from Sentinel-2 to get the LAI map of the sugarcane crop. The methodology consists of three phases, (1) download, (2) preprocessing, and (3) retrieval model. The results show that through the methodology implemented, the LAI map of the area of interest planted with sugar cane can be obtained.},

While a class of processes prefers to minimize its distance to a particular process called the root, the other class prefers to maximize it; at the same time, all the processes seek to build a communication spanning tree with the maximum social welfare. The two state-of-the-art algorithms for this problem always guarantee the generation of a spanning tree that satisfies a condition of Nash equilibrium in the system; however, such a tree does not necessarily produce the maximum social welfare. In this paper, we propose a two-player coalition cooperative scheme for BAP, which allows some processes to perturb or break a Nash equilibrium to find another one with a better social welfare. By using this cooperative scheme, we propose a new algorithm called FFC-BAPS for BAP. We present both theoretical and empirical analyses which show that this algorithm produces better quality approximate solutions than former algorithms for BAP.},

While agile methodologies support and promote social activities and behaviors, the understanding of the social phenomena and challenges that arise during the transformation of traditional teams into agile teams is limited. We conducted an extensive 10-month case study in a software enterprise to analyze the changes in the communication and social interactions of employees during the transformation process, and to delineate the social challenges that arise during this process. Using social interaction registers, we collected data on the communication and social interactions of employees, first when they worked as a traditional team and then as an agile team. Then, we processed the data using social network analysis methods to identify the differences between these 2 types of teams and to create graphs of communication and social interaction networks. We identified that the transformation process influences formal, informal, oral, and written communication and increases conjunctive and disjunctive social interactions. Further, from the results of interviews conducted with all the enterprise members, we identified 5 social challenges to transforming a traditional team into an agile one. The results of this research suggest that the transformation process requires broad changes in the relationships and interactions among employees.},

In this paper, we address the automatic classification problem for the levels of mammographic density based on an evolutionary approach.

Currently, the computer-aided diagnosis has proved to be a useful tool in support of an experienced physician for the early detection of breast cancer. Several classification algorithms are used for the detection of early stages of breast cancer. However, the classification of mammary densities has been the least studied. Recent studies of classification methods for mammographic density levels consist of a stage of pre-processing of the image, extraction of characteristics, and choice of an efficient algorithm for classification.

The need of companies to develop software with quality has motivated the study of several methods for the development and execution of software testing.

In this paper, we propose a new method for the development and implementation of software testing. This method consists of the combination of the models TMMi (testing maturity model integrated), MoProSoft (software process model) and the software testing process for the university environment. In comparison with these models, our proposed method is adaptable for software developments for small to medium scale projects. It also adapts to the software development for different platforms, such as Web, mobile, and desktop. We show the effectivity of our proposed method through a study case for the website Allison. This website is a software developed by the mexican company Maldonado Sofware. As an additional contribution, we proposed a new classification of software testing according to its type of black box or white box testing. We performed 51 software testing from which, we identified 28 different types of failures. The results of the study case show the effectivity of our proposed method.},

To overcome this drawback, we address the BAP with an evolutionary algorithm, the EBAP. Later, we take advantage of the best properties of both algorithms, EBAP and CBAP, to generate a two-stage cascade evolutionary algorithm called FFC-BAP.

Unlike most genetic algorithms designed for color image denoising, our algorithm evolves a set of images instead of the set of parameters of the filters.

Our algorithm uses the preference of the processors as criteria to select a leader under symmetric or non-symmetric configurations. It is partially inspired on Xu and Srimani's algorithm, but we use a distributed daemon and randomization to break symmetry. We prove that our algorithm has an optimal average complexity time and performed simulations to verify our results.},

  abstract = {Summary form only given. We present a simulation of an acyclic n/spl times/n DR-Mesh on an n/spl times/n LR-Mesh. The simulation is efficient in regards to size since both models use the same number of processors. The worst execution time for this simulation is O(n/sup 2/) time, but we demonstrate that its average execution time is O(log n). The existing fastest simulation takes O(log n) time, but it uses an extremely large number of processors. On the other hand, the most efficient simulation in terms of size takes O(log/sup 2/ n) time with O(n/sup 4//log/sup 2/ n) processors. Both of the existing simulations are for the unrestricted DR-Mesh. This paper provides an important step to efficiently simulate the unrestricted DR-Mesh on weaker models such as the R-Mesh and the LR-Mesh.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
