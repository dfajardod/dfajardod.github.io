I am a titular professor in the Department of Systems and Computation at the [Tecnológico Nacional de México (TecNM) / Ciudad Guzmán](http://cdguzman.tecnm.mx) and a member of the [National System of Researchers by Conahcyt](https://conahcyt.mx/sistema-nacional-de-investigadores/) in Mexico. Additionally, I serve as an external professor in the [Doctoral Program in Information Technologies at the University of Guadalajara](https://dti.cucea.udg.mx/es/directorio/daniel-fajardo-delgado). Previously, I was a full-time professor at [TecNM / Tlajomulco](http://www.tlajomulco.tecnm.mx), where I held various administrative positions, including deputy director of administrative services, managing human, financial, and material resources.

I earned my D.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Computer Science from the [Centro de Investigación Científica y de Educación Superior de Ensenada (CICESE)](https://www.cicese.mx), Mexico, in 2011 and 2003, respectively. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Instituto Tecnológico de Ciudad Guzmán, obtained in 2001. 

My research interests include algorithm design, evolutionary computation, self-stabilizing distributed algorithms, and algorithmic game theory.
